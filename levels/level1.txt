Description: This collection name derives from 'choripan', an spanish word that means
             'sandwich of sausage'. This collection includes two subsets called 'chorimalism'
             (7) and 'susi' (10). The 'chorimalism' subset (that is, minimal levels for
             Choriban collection) is composed by levels of 2 boxes, and the subcollection
             called 'susi' is formed by levels of small dimensions, experimenting with
             different number of boxes, from 2 to 7. The rest of the levels have a small
             size, normally with 3 boxes. Finally, the last two levels are based in David W.
             Skinner's 'Microban 60', that I have called 'stack-machines'.
